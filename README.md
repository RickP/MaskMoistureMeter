# MaskMoistureMeter

A simple device that measures the moisture of face masks. It uses a 555 timer to measure the resistance of cloth.

If the mask is dry, it lights up a green LED. If the mask is moist it blinks a red LED and also beeps with a piezo buzzer.
The faster is blinks and the higher the beepers pitch the more moisture is in your mask.

Replace and/or wash moist masks immediately as wearing a wet mask is dangerous to your health.

The electronics was designed in kicad and has all information tor order it assembled from JLCPCB.
